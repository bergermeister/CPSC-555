      <P>
         I enjoy developing Web Applications Using ASP.<BR>
         ASP has several COM based prebuilt objects that <BR>
         can be used in a scripting language such as VBscript,<BR>
         or Javascript, or Perlscript etc..
      </P>
      <P>
         ASP is easy to learn and you can create very useful Web <BR>
         applications relatively quickly, with it <BR>
      </P>
      To learn more about ASP, I will recommend taking a course on it
