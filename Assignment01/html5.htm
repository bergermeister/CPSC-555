      <P>
         I enjoy developing Web Applications Using ASP.
         ASP has several COM based prebuilt objects that 
         can be used in a scripting language such as VBscript,
         or Javascript, or Perlscript etc..
      </P>
      <P>	
         ASP is easy to learn and you can create very useful Web 
         applications relatively quickly, with it 
      </P>
      To learn more about ASP, I will recommend taking a course on it
